\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document demonstrates the format requirements for papers submitted
to the British Machine Vision Conference.  The format is designed for
easy on-screen reading, and to print well at one or two pages per sheet.
Additional features include: pop-up annotations for
citations~\cite{Authors06,Mermin89}; a margin ruler for reviewing; and a
greatly simplified way of entering multiple authors and institutions.

{\bf All authors are encouraged to read this document}, even if you have
written many papers before.  As well as a description of the format, the
document contains many instructions relating to formatting problems and
errors that are common even in the work of authors who {\em have}
written many papers before.
